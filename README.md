# Tic Tac Toe

If you're new to React and want a quick overview of the library, then following [this](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial on their official website could really be helpful. The tutorial explains how to build a tic-tac-toe game using React and there are some [further improvements](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up) that are left as an exercise to the readers. Here I am going to explain my solution to those listed improvements.

# Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssmkhrj/tic-tac-toe-react.git
cd tic-tac-toe-react
npm install
npm start
```

# Starter Code

[This](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010) is where the official React tutorial ended. So, we will be starting from here onwards.
